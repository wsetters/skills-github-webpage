My First Blog Entry

Hello everyone! My name is Spencer, and I am a paramedic and a student at the University of North Dakota. This is my very first blog post on my journey to learn how to use GitHub and other tools to build websites and apps.

My Background

As a paramedic, I have always been passionate about helping people in critical situations. Now, I am excited to combine my medical knowledge with technology to create innovative solutions.

My Goals

- Learn GitHub: Understanding version control and collaboration on GitHub.
- Build Websites: Start with simple websites and gradually move to complex projects.
- Develop Apps: Learn the basics of app development and eventually create useful applications.

I'm looking forward to sharing my learning journey with you all. Stay tuned for more updates and tutorials as I explore the world of web and app development!

Thank you for reading!

Best regards,  
Spencer
